# Define a function find_and_replace(), which takes in 3 arguments:
# a filename, a word to the found a replaced and the replacement string.
# It should like so:
# find_and_replace('story.txt', 'Alice', 'Colt') 
# story.txt now contains the first chapter of my new book,
# Colt's Adventures in Wonderland

def find_and_replace(f_name, old_word, new_word):
    with open(f_name) as fp:
        for line in fp:
            wordlist = line.split()
            newlist = [new_word if w == old_word else w for w in wordlist]
            print(line)
            print(wordlist)
            print(newlist)

find_and_replace('koe.txt', 'Alice', 'Colt')
