Validation exercises:
    - 'validation.py' contains the  exercises 'is_number' and 'is_hex_color' at
    the end of the file. These functions were covered by the 'test.py'
    unittests correctly, but the instructions for them were missing in

    Thus it was a little unclear to me what it takes to qualify as a number 
    or as a valid RGB hex color code. But then again, it was not too big 
    a deal to google the missing pieces of information from the web...
