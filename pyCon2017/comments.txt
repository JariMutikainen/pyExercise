Validation exercises:
    - 'validation.py' contains the  exercises 'is_number' and 'is_hex_color' at
    the end of the file. These functions were covered by the 'test.py'
    unittests correctly, but the instructions for them were missing in

    Thus it was a little unclear to me what it takes to qualify as a number 
    or as a valid RGB hex color code. But then again, it was not too big 
    a deal to google the missing pieces of information from the web...

Searching exercises:
    - I liked the fact that you had actually provided the lines of code 
    for reading in the contents of the input file 'dictionary.txt'.
    It speeded up getting started with the exercises. After all
    the purpose of these exercises is to learn to use the
    regexps in Python. From that point of view having to first figure out how
    to get the input data into the functions would have just been an
    unnecessary distraction from the intended focus.
